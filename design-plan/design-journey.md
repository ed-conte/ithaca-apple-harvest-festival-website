# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Existing Project (Milestone 1)

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

### Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project 2


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. (1-2 sentences)
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

The audience for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival Website is Ithaca area residents. This cohesive audience includes Cornell undergrad students and graduate students, and does not discriminate based on location, whether that be North campus, West campus, or off campus. Ithaca college students and Ithaca high school students are also included. Additionally, this audience accounts for Ithaca town residents and university professors who do not fall under the student designation.

## Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)

### Modal Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for **modal** interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience. (1 sentence)
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Idea 1: date and time

  the date, time, and location will be displayed in a modal when the website is opened prompting user input.

  Introducing a modal that displays the date, time, and location of the festival would facilitate meeting user goals. This implementation would assist participants in effectively planning ahead and attending the festival. Including this information in a modal isolates this information from the page so users do not have to search for it.

- Idea 2: map

  The festival map will be displayed in a modal when the user enters the "Vendors" page separating it from the other content on the page and highlighting its importance. A user can click out of the map at any time. During the user research process, a primary user goal was locating vendors on the map. Including the map in a modal would fulfill that user goal, and facilitate concise website navigation.

- Idea 3: photo carousel

  on the homepage there exists a large decorative image, changing that image to a carousel where users can look through a group of images of the festival would further users' understanding of the festival's imagery. Users expressed interest in engaging with content that fits into the fall aesthetic when attending the festival during interviews. Including a carousel of images that depict the festival decor and



### Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch at least two iterations of the modal and at least two iterations of the hamburger menu interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)

TODO: design sketches


### Final Interactivity Design Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Create _polished_ sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

**Modal design sketches:**

TODO: final design sketch(es)

**Hamburger drop-down navigation menu design sketches:**

TODO: final design sketch(es)


### Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (2-4 sentences)

The primary purpose of implementing a map modal on the "Vendor" page is to provide visitors with a visual representation of vendor locations, making it easier for them to navigate the event and plan their visit. This interactive design enhances the user experience by allowing attendees to pinpoint specific lanes that house the vendors they wish to visit, understand the event's layout, and strategize their route. For the site's intended audience, which includes Ithaca area residents both first-time attendees and returning visitors, this feature addresses their need for efficient navigation and maximizes their enjoyment of the festival.

Implementing a date, time, and location modal on the homepage serves as an immediate and concise reminder of the event's schedule, ensuring that visitors are well-informed and can plan accordingly. By prominently displaying this information, the site caters to its audience's primary need: understanding where and when the festival occurs. For potential attendees, especially those juggling other commitments, having easy access to the date and time details reduces the likelihood of scheduling conflicts and enhances their overall event participation.

## Interactivity Implementation Plan (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Planning Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.
> Your planning sketches should include _all_ HTML elements needed for the interactivity; _annotations_ for the element types, their unique IDs, and CSS classes; and lastly the initial CSS classes.

> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Do not put JavaScript code here.

**Modal pseudocode:**

Open the modal:

```
when user enters the vendor page
show vendor map above page content
dim content behind large vendor map
```

Close the modal:

```
when user clicks outside the vendor map (dimmed area)
un-dim vendor page
hide large vendor map
```

**Hamburger menu pseudocode:**

Pseudocode to show/hide (toggle) the navigation menu (narrow screens):

when the user clicks on the hamburger menu icon
change navigation list flexbox to row
move the navigation list below the site title
reveal navigation list below title
when user clicks hamburger menu icon while its open

```
when user widens the screen past --px
hide hamburger menu icon
change navigation list flexbox to column
move the navigation list inline with the site title
show navigation list
```

Pseudocode to show the hamburger button and hide the navigation menu when the window is resized too narrow:

```
when the user narrows the screen past --px
show the hamburger menu icon
hide navigation list
